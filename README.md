# Puppeteer Quotes Scraper

This is a simple Node.js project that uses **Puppeteer** to scrape quotes, authors, and tags from [QuotesToScrape](http://quotes.toscrape.com) â€” a website built for web scraping practice.

The script launches a headless browser, navigates to the site, and extracts quote blocks from the DOM, returning them as a structured JSON array.
